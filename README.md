# AirQo-African-11th-Place-Solution
### Project Description

Air pollution causes 7 million premature deaths annually, especially affecting poor communities in developing countries. This project aims to estimate PM2.5 levels in eight African cities using satellite data and machine learning. The cities are Lagos, Accra, Nairobi, Yaoundé, Bujumbura, Kisumu, Kampala, and Gulu. Ground-based observations will validate the estimates. Models will be deployed on AirQo’s platform, empowering communities with crucial air quality information to address pollution and improve public health.

### Objectives

1. **Estimate PM2.5 Levels**: Use satellite observations to estimate PM2.5 levels in eight African cities.
2. **Develop Machine Learning Models**: Create algorithms to process satellite data for accurate PM2.5 estimation.
3. **Validate Estimates**: Use ground observations in selected cities to ensure model accuracy.
4. **Deploy on AirQo Platform**: Make air quality information accessible via AirQo’s digital platform.
5. **Community Empowerment**: Provide evidence to help communities tackle pollution and improve public health.
6. **Environmental Protection**: Support interventions for urban vulnerability risk, health preservation, and climate change mitigation.
7. **City Focus**: Train models on data from Kampala, Lagos, Nairobi, and Bujumbura; test on Kisumu, Gulu, Accra, and Yaoundé.
